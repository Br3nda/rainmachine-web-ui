#RainMachine Web UI 

This is the web interface for the RainMachine Mini-8 and RainMachine HD-12/16. It uses basic API calls as documented
[here](http://docs.rainmachine.apiary.io/).

For the time being the only external library used is [HighCharts](http://highcharts.com). For basic DOM manipulations
see js/dom.js 

Code contributions are welcomed, although they aren't guaranteed to be included in the RainMachine updates.

For a list of contribuitors see AUTHORS file.
